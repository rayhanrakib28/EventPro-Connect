# EventPro Connect

## Projects Features

1. You will receive event cards that are categorized and offer comprehensive information so you can quickly figure out the goals of the event.
2. Because the site has a private route, users who attempt to access it are redirected to the login page.
3. Anyone with an email address and password can register. Also available is the Continue with Google Popup Method of Login.
4. Users can access the event details page and bookmark events after logging in.
5. The Saved Bookmark event can be found on the Bookmarked page, but because it is a private route, you must log in.
6. You can quickly save a bookmark-marked event, and it won't be erased when you leave.
7. On the profile page, logged-in users can change their username and profile photo.
8. When you click on your profile picture in the navbar, a drop-down menu will appear. Your name and a sign-out button will be visible if you are logged in. If not, a sign-in button will show up. The site's sign-in and sign-out processes are easy to do.
